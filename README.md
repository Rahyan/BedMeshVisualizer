# BedMeshVisualizer v1.0.5
Visualize your 3D Printer Bed from Marlin's G29 command output (as well as Prusa's G81 command). Helps for Bed Levelling.

Can be found at https://bedmesh.com

## Features
This is still a "beta" project, meaning that this section will get to be updated over new releases. So as of now (April 1st - v1.0.5), there are the following features :

- Convert command output/result to plot ;
- Settings section, still empty yet ;
- Stats section, with average/standard derivation, min/max values as well as the difference of both. Plus the avergage values ;
- Versatile and efficient management - you can add panels at your leisure, and display whatever you want with each of them.
- Easter egg when the bed is properly leveled.
- Values storage - your data (the outputs you've visualized) are saved locally, in your computer using the `Web Storage API` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API). Will probably add an option to save it in a database.

## Potential Features

- Blog through a PHP homemade CMS ;
- Forum ;
- Contact form (for support and suggestions, as well as issues reporting (though there's GitHub for that) ;
- Required degrees of rotation on the screws to level the bed perfectly ;
- Expression in other units, I'll probably release a variety of these and find out if they're useful or not.
- Analytics (+ setting to disable it) - the visualized values are saved to see if the plot was properly rendered or not. If there's an error. The user will be able to report it too.
- Illustration on where to level the bed. Thinking of a heatmap.
- Some AI stuff maybe ?
